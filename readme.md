# Data Visualization - Ford GoBike (Bike Shares)


## Dataset
The dataset, 2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv, is downloaded from [Ford GoBike](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html). This dataset includes 519,700 trips with 15 features such as locations, time, and user attributes. There are start and end stations. I noticed that most trips happen on the similar stations, so I subset the dataset by choosing start top 8 trips stations. Also, the program launched since June, 28th, 2017, so I remove June's data because of lack of insufficient data. Thus, the following analysis is performed by this subsetted dataset.
